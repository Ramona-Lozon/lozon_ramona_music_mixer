Music Mixer assignment for Multimedia Authoring 2
By Ramona Lozon
for Tina Vandervecht

all sounds sourced from [Zapsplat.com](https://www.zapsplat.com/)

plan for this assignment

    I plan on creating a small nature scene, where you can drag and drop several elements to que up certain ambient noises. i've found files for rain, wind, insects, streams, etc and made sure the sounds will be able to mix well when played in tandem.

    when finished, it should allow you to recreate the sounds of sitting in a forest. i hope the project will be able to create a relaxing and peaceful atmosphere.

    i've grabbed some inspirational pictures of forests, i plan on making a cute scene in adobe illustrator and ive included an example (example-pexels-bruno-glastch.jpg)
